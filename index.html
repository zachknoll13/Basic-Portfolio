  <p>My name is Zach Knoll and I am very new to the Web Development World.
    Currently, I am a Parks Maintenance Worker for the City of Lenexa. It is a great place
    of employment but I dont see myself there long term. That's not all there is to me though!
    I play guitar in a band and I also love walking and playing with my dog Bo! I also love spending time with my 
    wife.
  </p>
  <p>I am going through a coding bootcamp course right now and I am hoping to develop the necessary skills to
    be proficient in the profession. It will be a lot of hours and hardwork but I expect it to pay off ten fold.
    Here's to the future!
